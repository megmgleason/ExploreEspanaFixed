  <div class="question"> How do I choose a User?</div>
  <ul class="cell a1">The user can be chosen by doing a random trivia game, rock paper scissors, or a sword fight.</ul>
  <br><br>

    <div class="question">How should the User start?</div>
    <ul class="cell a2">If I'm not there to set it up, have the User complete the tutorial so they know how to work the controllers. However, have them SKIP the last step so that they can't save a location or see a previously saved location. Or you could just wing it.<i> It's important that I (or the teacher) choose the correct place to start.</i></ul>
    <br><br>

    <div class="question">How does the User move?</div>
    <ul class="cell a3">Following the tutorial, the user must use only the RIGHT contoller. Toggle the back button to move. The user does NOT need to leave the ground for the scavenger hunt, or else they will get very confused.</ul>
    <br><br>

    <div class="question">Can the rest of the class be involved?</div>
    <ul class="cell a4">Cálmate, the rest of the class will participate. There will be prompts and opprotunites to interact, and students should try to make the most of their part.</ul>
    <br><br>

    <div class="question">What are the cards for?</div>
    <ul class="cell a5">The cards are for the other students to have a part in the experience. When prompted, the student should do the action/read the prompt on the card.</ul>
    <br><br>

    <div class="question">What should I do if the user gets lost?</div>
    <ul class="cell a6">Great question. If they get off track, guide them back on the course. If all else fails have the class close their eyes and have me fix it.<em> A note for the user: please don't fly. It'll make it harder for all of us.</em> </ul>
    <br><br>

    <div class="question">What else should I do?</div>
    <ul>Explore España should be as interactive as possible, so if the teacher has any ideas on how to involve more of the class, we're open to any opprotunites to improve.</ul>
